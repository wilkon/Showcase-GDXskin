# Showcase-GDXskin
Showcasing the skins available on GDX-Skin project

I'm using this project to practice my interfacing abilities with Scene2d and the GDX-Skins available. I felt it would also serve a purpose in allowing Game Creators to pick and choose a UI based on an actual experience using them.

I'll eventually expand the skin coverage to multiple platforms, but I'm currently working on the Desktop versions.

<h2>Launching</h2>

set VM options to -XstartOnFirstThread and run from DesktopLauncher
